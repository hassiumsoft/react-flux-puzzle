## The reason

I started this project with the intuit to apply some technologies that I have been studying in the last few months..
this is the real first app that I wrote using stuff such as [Rx.js](http://reactivex.io/), [React](https://facebook.github.io/react/) and [Immutable.js](https://facebook.github.io/immutable-js/),
so please, I would love to get some feedback to improve my code üòÄ

I was inspired by the great game [Alien Isolation](http://www.alienisolation.com/) which you can play a very similar puzzle:
